          <h4>Chiropractic Care for Auto Accident Victims</h4>
          <p class="font-weight-light">Accident Injury Center specializes in providing advanced chiropractic care to victims of automobile accidents. The treatment we provide is designed to help patients get relief, make a complete recovery, and regain their earlier physical abilities. We have worked with hundreds of patients who had been involved in vehicular accidents. This includes both pedestrians and drivers, those who have been injured in hit-and-run accidents, and individuals who have suffered workplace and slip-and-fall accident injuries. We not only treat patients but also collaborate with the patient's attorney on insurance matters to help victims claim the compensation they deserve.</p>
          <p class="font-weight-light">The common physical symptoms of car injuries are pain, stiffness in the muscles, spasms, numbness, and back pain along with pain in the neck and head. Additionally, auto accident victims may suffer fatigue,  insomnia, and difficulty concentrating. Whether or not a car accident victim exhibits these telltale signs of injury, it is critical that he visits a doctor.</p>

          <h4>Our Treatment Methods</h4> 
          <p class="font-weight-light">Often soft tissue injuries have resulted and  may not yet be obvious to the victim. Your doctor carries out a thorough examination of a patient's injuries. Based on the findings, your doctor constructs a customized and comprehensive chiropractic care plan designed to facilitate a complete recovery and help the patient return to active living. The doctors of Accident and Injury Center and their medical staff have a proven track record of successful chiropractic care. Their accurate diagnosis and effective treatment methods decrease the likelihood of recurring symptoms. For example, post-traumatic osteoarthritis caused by a car accident injury can occur many days or months after the accident. This condition leads to poor posture, degenerative disc disorder, and may cause the partial or total loss of motion in the affected area. Treating this condition is expensive, may involve taking time off from work, and can cause emotional trauma.</p>
          <p class="font-weight-light">Our chiropractic treatments are designed to not only address the patient's current relief needs, but also to reduce the risk of recurring health problems like these down the line. At the Accident and Injury Center, we not only offer comprehensive diagnostic and treatment facilities but also work with attorneys so that our patients can obtain fair compensation.</p>
